# PROXY
Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder object to control access to another, different object. The Proxy object can be used in the same manner as its containing object.

## PROBLEM
Why would you want to control access to an object? Here is an example: you have a massive object that consumes a vast amount of system resources. You need it from time to time, but not always.

## SOLUTION
The Proxy pattern suggests that you create a new proxy class with the same interface as an original service object. Then you update your app so that it passes the proxy object to all of the original objectâ€™s clients. Upon receiving a request from a client, the proxy creates a real service object and delegates all the work to it.

# THE STRUCTURE

## The Subject
 defines a common interface for the RealSubject and the Proxy such that the Proxy can be used anywhere the RealSubject is expected.

## The RealSubject
 defines the concrete object which the Proxy represents.

## The Proxy
 maintains a reference to the RealSubject and controls access to it. It must implement the same interface as the RealSubject so that the two can be used interchangeably.
