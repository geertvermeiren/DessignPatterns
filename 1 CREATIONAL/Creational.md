CREATION PATTERNS structure
## ABSTRACT FACTORY = families of related products without specifying their concrete class

- abstract factory interface
-concrete factory 
    return concrete product
-abstract product
-concrete product
-client
    clientmethod

## BUILDER =production process in stept. build objects step by step
- organize ojbect construction in step + buildwall, buildroof

IBuilder

Concrete builder

product

directory


## FACTORY METHOD: create object in superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that are created

- creator
- concrete creator
- product
- concrete product

## PROTOTYPE
- shallowcopy
-deep copy

## SINGLETON
- singleton

# ABSTRACT FACTORY = GROUP FAMILIES OF RELATED PRODCUTS WITHOUT SPECIFYING THEIR CONRETE CLASSES
